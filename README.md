# Next.js Lucia Auth template

> I've planned other features in this template, so stay tuned

If you think setting up authentication is a pain, then this is the right template for you.


All you need to do is clone this repo and install the dependencies.

Features:
- A simple Sign In / Sign Up form with react-hook-form.
- Zod validation for username and password.
- Biome JS for fast lint & formatting.
- Prisma Schema already set up with SQLite (you could change it easily).
- Shadcn UI already set up.
- Of course, it's using Typescript
